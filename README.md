## Installation Instructions
The user **must**  install Jupyter Notebooks prior to running [(squrrels.ipynb)](squrrels.ipynb) script.

All installation methods and requirements can be found [here](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/install/notebook-classic.html#:~:text=Jupyter%20installation%20requires%20Python%203.3,%2C%20pip%2C%20instead%20of%20Anaconda.)

It is recommended to download [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) for an easier installation(Other libraries such as Numpy,pandas,seaborn,matplotlib,sklearn will be installed automatically)

If any **errors** are encountered during the installation, use the [troubleshoot](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/troubleshooting/) forum
